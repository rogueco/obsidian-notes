## Introduction to Algorithms

Most people don't realize this simple fact but, we all deal with algorithms on a daily basis. An algorithm is defined in Webster's dictionary as "a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer: "

The first part is what you may be able to relate to. A process. A process that is followed to accomplish something. A recipe with instructions for how to mix and bake a cake in an oven is a process and is also an algorithm. It is a set of steps or rules to follow for a successful outcome.

There is a key piece of information missing in the above definition that is critical. The algorithm should produce the correct result. Does it have to do this all the time? Of course, it should, or we should find another algorithm that does produce the correct result every time.

As an example, consider a typical morning routine where you wake up and get ready for work or school. Let's list the steps that you might go through for this routine:

1. Alarm clock wakes you (you decide to wake up and get ready for the day, or not)
2. You shower
3. You dress for the day
4. You potentially eat breakfast
5. You leave the house and head to work or school

If you perform these steps in order and you arrive at your destination, then the algorithm is correct in the way it is written above. It is a process or set of rules that you follow to successfully get up in the morning and head to work. What happens if this algorithm isn't quite right?

Consider if you reversed steps 2 and 3 above. You can still arrive at work but is the algorithm producing a correct result? You arrive at work in wet clothes so perhaps, it's not quite right.

In programming, you will be formulating algorithms on a regular basis. This lesson will help you start thinking about algorithms and how you can evaluate the steps needed to accomplish a task, create a working algorithm, translate that to code, and then test it to make sure it is correct.
