## Basic Implementation of a shell script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# Author : Tom Fletcher
# Copyright (c) None
# Script follows here:

echo "What is your name?"
read PERSON
echo "Hello, $PERSON"
```

The above, we are using zsh as our default script language - If you are using bash, swap out to use bash.

# Script file Execution

To make the script **Executable** you will need to run the following command

```bash
chmod +x {pathToDirectory/File}
chmod +x test.sh
```

### To Run Script

To run your script just run the following command

```bash
./{fileName}

./test.sh
```

# Decision Making - ZSH & Bash.

```bash
#Bash

#!/bin/sh

a=10
b=20

if [ $a == $b ]
then
   echo "a is equal to b"
fi

if [ $a != $b ]
then
   echo "a is not equal to b"
fi

#ZSH
#!/bin/sh

a=10
b=20

if [[ $a == $b ]]
then
   echo "a is equal to b"
fi

if [[ $a != $b ]]
then
   echo "a is not equal to b"
fi

```

 

# Operators

<aside>
ðŸ”’ The following points need to be considered while adding âˆ’

There must be spaces between operators and expressions. For example, 2+2 is not correct; it should be written as 2 + 2.

The complete expression should be enclosed between â€˜ â€˜, called the backtick.
