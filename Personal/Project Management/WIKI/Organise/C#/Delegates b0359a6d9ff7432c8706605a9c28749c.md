# Delegates

Created: July 6, 2020 11:22 AM

A Delegate in its simplest form is a pointer to another method.

You can call the method via the use of a delegate proving it has a matching signature

```csharp
public int MethodIWantToCall(string input)
{
	return input.Length;
}

int answer = p1.MethodIWantToCall("Frog");

// Delegate

delegate int DelegateWithMatchingSignature (string s);

// Create a delegate instance that points to the method
var d = DelegateWithMatchingSignature(p1.MehtodIWantToCall);

// call the delegate. which calles the method
int answer2 = d("Frog")
```

## What's the point?

Well, delegates provide flexibility. In *C# 8.0 with [ASP.NET](http://asp.NET) Core 3.0* the following is described:

> ... we could use delegates to create a queue of methods that need to be called in order. Queuing actions that need to be performed is common in services to provide improved scalability.
> 

Delegates have built in support for asynchronous operations that run on a different thread. Essentially allowing things to run in tandem of each other improving responsiveness. 

## Most Important Example

> ...delegates allow us to implement events for sendings messages between different objects that do not need to know about each other.

```csharp
// event delegate field
public EventHandler Shout;

// data field
public int AngerLevel

// method
public void Poke(){
	AngerLevel++
	if (AngerLevel >= 3) 
	{
		// If something is listening....
		// C# 8.0
		Shout?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);

		// C# 
		// if (Shout != null) 
		// {
		//   Shout(this, EventArgs.Empty);
		// }
	}
}

private static void Harry_Shout (object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	Person p = (Person)sender;
	WriteLine($"{p.name} is this angry: {p.AngerLevel}");
}

// Main

harry.Shout = Harry_Shout;

harry.poke;
harry.poke;
harry.poke;
harry.poke;

// Returns: 'Harry is this angry: 3'
// Returns: 'Harry is this angry: 4'
```
