# Rock #1

### Unit Tests

As I progress at Inflo, I'd like to broaden my knowledge in best practices when it comes to unit testing. Any new methods which I write, if applicable I will aim to write a unit test which will (hopefully) stop code regression.

# Rock #2

### WebMS - TODO

In the solution as a whole there are over 500 TODO comments & NotImplementedException. My Rock, is essentially to attempt to catalogue all issues in WebMS & turn them into tickets if they are decided to still be required.

# Rock #3

### Learn Blazor

This is more of a loose rock. Essentially I just want to expand my knowledge within Blazor so if the company were to implement this within the stack I could hit the ground running - I'd do research & tutorials in my own time.
