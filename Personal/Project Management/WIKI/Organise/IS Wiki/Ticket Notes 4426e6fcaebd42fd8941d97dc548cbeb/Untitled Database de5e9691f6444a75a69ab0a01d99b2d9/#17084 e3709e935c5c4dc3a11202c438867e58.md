# Issue Identified reason

- engagementId is not being set - it is stating that it is NaN (Not a number)

### Notes

- QueryString is an empty object
- engagementRequestOverviews is an empty array which we are trying to get the engagementId from

```json
// Props

engagementRequestOverviews: []
engagementRequestOverviewsPaginatedData: {count: 0, hasNext: false, hasPrevious: false}
filters: null
getEngagementRequestOverviews: (filters, paginationParams, clear = false) => {…}
history: {length: 6, action: "POP", location: {…}, createHref: ƒ, push: ƒ, …}
isFetchingRequests: false
listenToIonEventEmitter: (filters, paginationParams) => {…}
location: {pathname: "/requests/list/1/25", search: "", hash: "", state: undefined}
match: {path: "/requests/list/:pageNumber/:pageSize", url: "/requests/list/1/25", isExact: true, params: {…}}
methodsToDispatch: values => {…}
queryStrings: {}
staticContext: undefined
urlParameters: {pageNumber: "1", pageSize: "25"}
__proto__: Object

```

- queryString is grabbed from `getPropsFromUrl.tsx` - this is getting what is passed into e.g. pageNumber & pageSize. The engagementId, is never passed in.
- Dashboard controller ln 102 - RequestsUri is used in one place
