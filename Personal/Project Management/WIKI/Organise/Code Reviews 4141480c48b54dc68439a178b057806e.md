# Preparing Code for Review

Preparation sets your reviewers up for success.

### Commit Messages

Make sure your commit messages are descriptive. 

### Github PR Descriptions

Your PR descriptions should be an extension of your commit messages. Write about both what the commit changes, and how you implemented the change. 

# Performing Code Reviews

### How to Review

- Make two passes over the PR if it's substantial.
    - On the first pass, come to an understanding of the code change at a high level.
    - On the second pass, pay more attention to semantic details.

# Examples

```jsx
var commentCount = 0;
```

You might suggest that this be a `let` instead of `var`.
