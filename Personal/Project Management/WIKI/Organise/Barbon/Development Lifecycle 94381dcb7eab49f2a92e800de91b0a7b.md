You can link to other pages in your workspace in a couple ways:

- Type `/link`, press `enter`, and type the name of the page you want. This creates a link like this one:

[Engineering Guidelines](Engineering%20Guidelines%20226021bffdd24094b018c5c06ae7b8f8.md)

- To create a link inline, type `@` followed by the title of the page, then press `enter`. The result looks like this: [Engineering Guidelines](Engineering%20Guidelines%20226021bffdd24094b018c5c06ae7b8f8.md)

# 3. Create a pull request on Github

Include the Notion task link in your PR description. 

# 4. Submit for review
