# Processes

### Making Code Changes

- Test PRs rigorously before requesting review.
- Include test cases you've checked for in your PR description.

### Reviewing Code

- If the change is substantial and user-facing, pull down the branch.
- Test for cases (particularly edge cases) that the PR author may have missed.

### QA

- Look at the list of items going out for release the next day.
- Go down the list one-by-one and thoroughly test changes.
