# Routing - Route Names

Created: August 28, 2020 3:46 PM

## **Route name**

The following code defines a route name of `Products_List`:

C#Copy

```csharp
[ApiController]
public class Products2ApiController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("/products2/{id}", Name = "Products_List")]
    public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
    {
        return ControllerContext.MyDisplayRouteInfo(id);
    }
}

```

Route names can be used to generate a URL based on a specific route. Route names:

- Have no impact on the URL matching behavior of routing.
- Are only used for URL generation.

Route names must be unique application-wide.

Contrast the preceding code with the conventional default route, which defines the `id` parameter as optional (`{id?}`). The ability to precisely specify APIs has advantages, such as allowing `/products` and `/products/5` to be dispatched to different actions.
