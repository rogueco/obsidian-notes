A object is how we model real life objects. It's how we group information. 

An object is basically a block of memory that has been allocated and configured according to the blueprint. A program may create many objects of the same class. Objects are also called instances, and they can be stored in either a named variable or in an array or collection.

Take a car for example the car can have the following:

- Wheels
- Manufacture
- Number of windows
- Colour
- Number Of Doors

```csharp
Car car = new Car()
{
	Name = "Meh",
	Brand = "BMW"
}
```

objects can be an instance of a class
