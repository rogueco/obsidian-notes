Good microcopy is one of the fastest ways to improve an interface. Try doing an audit on your UI with these tips to see how it stands up.

## **1. Use personal pronouns**

Address the reader instead of just talking out loud. Use the word *you*. People pay more attention when you talk directly to them.

## **2. Start with a verb**

Names for interactive elements should begin with an action verb. The same goes for important copy. Starting with a verb is more direct and engaging.

## **3. Prevent concerns**

Point out concerning actions before your user can worry about your motives. Be transparent—make sure they understand what they’re doing and why.

## **4. Use natural language**

Write conversationally, like you’re one-on-one. Be professional but get rid of jargon. Use familiar, simple words with a friendly, relaxed tone.

## **5. Default to active voice**

Most of the time, active voice is the way to go. It’s easier to understand than passive voice, feels more personal, and is often shorter and stronger.

## **6. Show useful error messages**

Avoid negative, threatening, or overly technical words. Be friendly, show empathy, take the time to explain what’s going on, and be helpful.

## **7. Write iteratively**

We write code iteratively, so not why everything else? Things probably won’t be perfect the first time around. Test, refine, ship again. It adds up.
