## Premise


## Meeting Notes

### General

Option **B**

1. If a member has _not_ returned a score for handicapping purposes in the period specified, the lowest HI column is to show the lowest HI on the report as the value in place at the time the period started.  Can you confirm whether you want to amend the report to the alternative?


2. If a member has returned sufficient scores for an HI to be awarded, but _not_ yet returned a score for handicapping purposes using their awarded HI, the report is to show the lowest HI on the report as the value in place currently, even though it has not been used yet for a returned score.  Can you confirm whether you want to amend the report to the alternative?  

3. If a member's most recent score has resulted in a new and reduced HI, which otherwise would be the lowest HI in the period specified, the report is to show the lowest HI on the report as the value in place currently, even though it has not been used yet for a returned score.  Can you confirm whether you want to amend the report to the alternative?

If you could let us know asap on these three cases, (whether to A leave as current or B change to the alternative), that would be great, as we are very keen to get this one finalised today if possible.  We are happy to jump on a call to discuss these circumstances if it is easier, but I thought it better to document these cases to start us off.
