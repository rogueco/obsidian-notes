## Bug Details

Good afternoon,

Just checking if you had a response on this one please? Ideally, we would like to get up to date data on iGolf subscribers pushed from WHS portal to CRM. If this is not possible, we need to consider other options asap.

Good afternoon,

In addition to the email below, is there an option you can force a refresh/push the iGolf subscriber data via the API to CRM in order to update the fields direct from your portal to our CRM? Which would be a cleaner/quicker way to update all iGolf subscriber data in CRM in order for us to start with dynamic comms.

We are looking for up to date address data for iGolf subscribers:

Can you please confirm if a forced refresh/push of the iGolf subscriber address data is possible?

Mark – if you can foresee any issues with carrying out this process on our CRM can you please advise?

Thanks and kind regards,

Lea

Hello,

We are looking to correct any iGolfers who have the missing county field with the extract you provided.

However, after further investigations from Lea, it would appear the ‘City’ column would be the ‘County’ column.

Once we looked through the list of counties, we notice Towns and Cities where also included, which do not appear on the drop down of the sign up form.

Please can you confirm where these would have come from?
