_DP_ Thinks that we control the DNS Records Golf Ireland
_DP_ wants to know if it's possible for us to take a look into Adweb issues with the authorisation code note working for the current work around.



_TF_:
	Wondering that would be the effect of being behind a commit?
	different time zones etc.

As sent to matt, david, marcus: Update to all:  
1. We have asked EG to get their 3rd party company LCS to change the SPF record, confirming nemisys are no longer in the picture.  We've been given the info that this might take 24-48 hours to take effect. 
2. We have the same issues re undelivered emails in GI now, from the past few days, in lower numbers but displaying the same pattern.  Do we look after the GI SPF record still?  Can we check and see if a similar situation is preventing email delivery in GI, and change the record if we think it might help? 
3. It may be no 2 priority but the separate issue of verification codes seemingly expiring as soon as they are created continues to exist, preventing us performing our usual workaround for the verification email not arriving, (as opposed to the pw reset email).  What can we do to check why this might be?
