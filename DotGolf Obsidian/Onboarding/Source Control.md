Subversion Control

### Version Control Management Practice
The chosen development strategy at DotGolf is *Trunk based development (TBD)*.
*This is probably the best summary that I could find on TBD*

>Trunk-based development (TBD) is a software development strategy where engineers merge smaller changes more frequently into the main codebase and work off the trunk copy rather than work on long-lived [feature branches](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/feature-branch/). This development model is often leveraged as part of a continuous integration development workflow.

#### Key Benefits
- Work off a copy of the master (trunk)
- Smaller changes
- More frequent merges
