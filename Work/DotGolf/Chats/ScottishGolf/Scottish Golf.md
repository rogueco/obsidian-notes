## Premise


## Meeting Notes

### General

Tee booking huge, currently using two separate software venders for the club cms product and the Tee booking system. 

Paying subs, is very good  - slick. 

#important 
- Subscription process, constitution states that this needs to be taken during November. 
	- Direct Debits
	- Stripe

Facility booking system, not just a Tee booking system. Look at other revenue streams, looking at growing the clubs revenue.
- Driving ranges
- Simulators


stroke play, into matchplay, 36 holes on multiple courses, best back 9 of both courses (from second round)

In the app, it's just W/L/Half hole
-> Automatically, puts the winner into the next round.

Results page that all clubs have. 

## Long Term Vision
- When a member registers for teebooking, want that golfer to have a WHS number, so they are known to the NGB.
- Want to collect as many datapoints as possible.
